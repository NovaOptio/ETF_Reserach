# Investment Comparison Script

## Overview
This Python script compares the growth of two investment funds over a set number of years while considering different annual costs for each fund. It calculates and visualizes the future values of the investments, showcasing the impact of varying costs.

## Description
The script uses matplotlib and numpy libraries to create two essential plots:
1. **Investment Growth Comparison:** This plot shows how Fund 1 and Fund 2 evolve over time.
2. **Annual Cost Differences (Positive):** It illustrates the absolute annual difference in value between the two funds due to costs.

## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the script using a Python environment or IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
4. Modify the script's constants, such as `initial_investment`, `annual_growth_rate`, `cost_fund1_percentage`, `cost_fund2_percentage`, and `years`, to suit your scenario.
5. Run the script to see the investment comparison results and plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Example
Here's a sample example:
```python
# Constants
initial_investment = 10000
annual_growth_rate = 0.10
cost_fund1_percentage = 0.5  # %
cost_fund2_percentage = 0.05  # %
years = 30
